# Rule Management Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for creating, updating, and managing Cursor rules in the BibleScholarProject. 

## Creating Rules

Use the `create_cursor_rule.py` script to create new rules:

```bash
python scripts/create_cursor_rule.py rule_name "Rule Title" "Rule description" [glob_patterns]
```

### Options

- `--always-apply`: Apply the rule to all files
- `--content FILE`: Provide content from a file
- `--type TYPE`: Set rule type (restored or always)
- `--force`: Overwrite existing rules

## Rule Structure

Rules should follow this structure:

1. **Metadata**: YAML frontmatter with type, title, description, globs, and alwaysApply
2. **Content**: Markdown content with guidelines, examples, and references

## Rule Types

- **Feature Rules**: Guidelines for specific features
- **Standard Rules**: Project-wide coding and documentation standards
- **Reference Rules**: Links to detailed documentation

## Rule Organization

Rules are organized in these directories:

- `.cursor/rules/`: Root directory for all rules
- `.cursor/rules/features/`: Feature-specific rules
- `.cursor/rules/standards/`: Project-wide standards
- `.cursor/rules/tmp/`: Temporary/draft rules

## Best Practices

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Avoid creating duplicate rules
2. **Rule References**: Link to detailed documentation when available
3. **Examples**: Include code examples when relevant
4. **Focused Scope**: Keep each rule focused on a specific concern
5. **Glob Patterns**: Use specific glob patterns to target relevant files

## Updating Rules

When updating rules:

1. Update the content in the rule file
2. Run `python scripts/fix_mdc_files.py` to ensure proper formatting
3. Update related documentation as needed

## Managing Duplicates

If duplicate rules exist:
1. Identify the primary rule to keep
2. Consolidate content from other rules
3. Delete duplicate rules
4. Update glob patterns to ensure proper coverage
