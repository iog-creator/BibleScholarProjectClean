# ETL Parser Strictness Guidelines 
 
## Overview 
 
This rule defines standards for parser strictness levels in ETL processes. 
 
## Parser Strictness Levels 
 
ETL parsers should support the following strictness levels: 
 
1. **STRICT**: Fail on any formatting or data quality issue 
2. **NORMAL**: Fail on critical issues, log warnings for minor issues 
3. **LENIENT**: Attempt to recover from all errors, log warnings 
 
## Implementation Guidelines 
 
```python 
from enum import Enum 
 
class ParserStrictness(Enum): 
    STRICT = "strict"   # Fail on any issue 
    NORMAL = "normal"   # Default behavior 
    LENIENT = "lenient" # Best-effort parsing 
 
def parse_file(file_path, strictness=ParserStrictness.NORMAL): 
    # Implementation that respects strictness level 
    # ... 
``` 
 
## Error Handling 
 
1. Document which errors are considered critical vs. minor 
2. Log all issues regardless of strictness level 
3. Always include line number and context in error messages 
4. Provide summary statistics of issues encountered
