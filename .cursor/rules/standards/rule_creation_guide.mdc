# When to Create New Cursor Rules

For more detailed guidance, see [Rule Creation Guide](../docs/rules/rule_creation_guide.md).

## Key Indicators for New Rules

Create a new rule when you need to:

1. **Standardize repetitive patterns** - If you find yourself repeatedly giving the same guidance
2. **Enforce project conventions** - Coding standards, naming conventions, or architectural patterns
3. **Document complex domain knowledge** - Theological term handling, linguistic processing rules
4. **Provide context for specific file types** - Specialized handling for particular file formats
5. **Share institutional knowledge** - Help others understand project-specific concepts

## Rule Candidates by Category

### Code Standards

* ETL processing patterns
* Database access patterns
* Error handling conventions
* Logging standards
* API endpoint design
* Test skip conditions

### Domain Knowledge

* Theological term handling
* Biblical reference formats
* Linguistic processing rules
* Versification mapping

### Tool/Library Usage

* Pandas DataFrame guidelines
* DSPy training generation
* Database connection patterns
* ML model validation

## When NOT to Create Rules

Avoid creating rules when:

1. The guidance applies to only a single file
2. The pattern is standard across the industry (use existing documentation)
3. The rule would be too general to be helpful
4. The guidance changes frequently

## Rule Creation Decision Tree

```
Is this guidance repeated often? → YES → Consider a rule
             ↓ NO
Is this domain-specific knowledge? → YES → Consider a rule
             ↓ NO
Will multiple developers need this? → YES → Consider a rule
             ↓ NO
           Probably don't need a rule
```

## Rule Maintenance

* Review rules quarterly to ensure they remain relevant
* Update rules when project patterns evolve
* Delete outdated rules that no longer apply
* Consolidate related rules if they become fragmented
