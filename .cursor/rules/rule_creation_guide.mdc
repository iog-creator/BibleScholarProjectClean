## Agent Compatibility

To ensure rules work well with AI agents:

1. **Set `alwaysApply: false` by default** - This prevents rules from being auto-applied to all conversations, which can overwhelm agents with too many rules.

2. **Use specific glob patterns** - Target only the files where the rule is relevant to avoid rule noise.

3. **When to use `alwaysApply: true`**:
   - Only for critical rules that must ALWAYS be followed
   - For project-wide standards that apply universally
   - When providing essential context needed for all interactions

4. **Use the audit tools** to identify rules that should be converted to `alwaysApply: false`:
   ```powershell
   # Run the audit script
   .\scripts\cursor_rules\audit_rules_auto.ps1
   
   # Apply the fixes
   .\scripts\cursor_rules\fixes\apply_all_fixes.bat
   ```

## Rule Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `always` | Standard rule type | Most rules |
| `agentRequested` | Can be requested by agent | Reference material |

## Creating New Rules

### Option 1: Use the Management Scripts

The easiest way to manage rules is with the provided scripts:

```powershell
# Interactive rule management
.\scripts\cursor_rules\manage_rules.ps1

# Create a new rule
.\scripts\cursor_rules\create_rule.ps1 -RuleName "your_rule_name" -Title "Your Rule Title" -Description "Your rule description" -Globs @("**/path/to/*.py")

# Generate a non-interactive batch script
.\scripts\cursor_rules\generate_rule_script.ps1 -RuleName "your_rule_name" -Title "Your Rule Title" -Description "Your rule description" -Globs @("**/path/to/*.py")
```

### Option 2: Use the Template

1. Copy the template from `templates/cursor_rule_template.md`
2. Replace the placeholders with your rule content
3. Save to `.cursor/rules/your_rule_name.mdc`

### Option 3: Manual Creation

1. Create a new file in `.cursor/rules/` with `.mdc` extension
2. Add YAML frontmatter with required fields
3. Add detailed markdown content after the frontmatter

## Best Practices

1. **Descriptive titles and descriptions** - Make it clear what the rule does
2. **Specific glob patterns** - Target only files where the rule applies
3. **Avoid `alwaysApply: true`** - Set to false for most rules
4. **Include examples** - Show correct and incorrect usage
5. **Reference other files** - Use `@filename` syntax to include relevant file content
6. **Structure with headers** - Use clear section headings
7. **Code blocks with language** - Use proper syntax highlighting

## Testing Rules

To verify a rule is applied correctly:
1. Open a file matching the glob pattern
2. Check that the rule appears in the Cursor context
3. Verify the rule guidance is followed by the AI assistant
