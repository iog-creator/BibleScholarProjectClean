# Hebrew OT Words Debug Script Rule

## Purpose
This script helps developers and analysts debug and validate the population of word-level data in the bible.hebrew_ot_words table, especially after ETL or schema changes.

## Usage
- Run the script after any ETL or database update to confirm that words, Strong's IDs, and grammar codes are present for a given verse.
- By default, it prints all words for Genesis 1:1. Edit the script to change the reference if needed.
- If you see garbled output on Windows, set your terminal to UTF-8 (see script docstring).

## When to Use
- After running the TAHOT ETL pipeline
- When debugging API or downstream feature issues related to Hebrew word data
- When validating Strong's ID or grammar code extraction

## Example
```bash
python scripts/debug_hebrew_ot_words.py
```
