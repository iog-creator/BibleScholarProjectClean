# Documentation Usage Guidelines

## Finding Documentation

All project documentation is centralized in the `docs/` directory:

1. Start with `docs/README.md` for a comprehensive index of all documentation
2. For specific topics, consult the relevant documentation file:
   - API endpoints: `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
   - Database schema: `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
   - Development rules: `docs/rules/README.md`

## Documenting Code

When writing or modifying code, follow these documentation guidelines:

1. **Module Documentation**:
   - Include docstrings for all modules explaining their purpose
   - List key functions and classes at the top of the file

2. **Function Documentation**:
   - Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions
   - Include examples for complex functions

3. **Class Documentation**:
   - Document the purpose of the class and its main methods
   - Document class attributes and their expected types

## Referencing Documentation

When referencing documentation in code comments:

1. Use absolute paths from the project root:
   ```python
   # See docs/rules/theological_terms.md for term definitions
   ```

2. Reference specific sections when applicable:
   ```python
   # See "Database Access Patterns" in docs/rules/database_access.md
   ```

## Updating Documentation

When making changes to code that affect functionality:

1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Add an entry to the change history section if present
3. Ensure examples in documentation match the updated code

## Theological Term Documentation

Always consult `docs/rules/theological_terms.md` when working with Hebrew or Greek theological terms to ensure:

1. Proper Strong's ID mapping
2. Correct minimum occurrence requirements
3. Appropriate handling of term variants
