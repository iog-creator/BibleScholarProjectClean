# Server Startup and Infrastructure Patterns

Any new server startup pattern or infrastructure standard (such as the `server_utils.py` pattern for duplicate-safe, background server startup) must be:
- Documented in the project roadmap (see `docs/roadmaps/contextual_insights_feature_roadmap.md` section X)
- Added to the cursor rules (this file and `documentation_usage.md`)
- Referenced in all relevant scripts

This ensures consistency, discoverability, and maintainability across the project.
