This repository contains the full codebase and documentation for the BibleScholarLangChain project.

## 📄 License Notice

**🔒 Personal Biblical Use Only** - This software is licensed for **free personal biblical study, research, and educational use only**. Commercial use requires written permission and payment of licensing fees. See [LICENSE](../LICENSE) for full terms.

## 📚 Documentation Structure
- All documentation is now in the `docs/` directory:
  - `docs/features/` — Feature overviews and usage
  - `docs/rules/` — Project rules and standards
  - `docs/reference/` — API, schema, and technical reference
  - `docs/guides/` — Setup, testing, and data verification guides

## 🛠️ Rebuilding the System
To fully rebuild the system from scratch:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in `setup.ipynb` (auto-generated by `update_setup_notebook.py`).
3. Reference the documentation in `docs/` for features, rules, and architecture.
4. Do **not** add large data files (SQL, CSV, etc.) to the repo—see `.gitignore`.

## Key Scripts
- `update_setup_notebook.py`: **Refactored modular script** regenerates the enhanced setup notebook with license protection.
- `start_servers.bat`: Starts Enhanced API (5200) and Web UI (5300) servers.
- `scripts/`: Utility and test scripts including comprehensive testing framework.

## Notes
- All paths use forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility.
- All database access uses `psycopg3` (never `psycopg2`).
- For any changes, update both code and documentation to keep them in sync.

## MCP Rule: Database-Only Biblical Answers

- All biblical answers must come **only** from the `bible_db` database.
- LLMs (including LM Studio) may only summarize, paraphrase, or format results from the database.
- LLMs must **never** generate biblical content directly or use their own knowledge.
- If the answer is not in the database, the system must respond:

  > Sorry, I can only answer using the Bible database. No answer found for your query.

- This rule is enforced in all API endpoints, web UI, and LLM/system prompts.
