# Documentation Maintenance

## Purpose
Ensure all documentation is accurate, up-to-date, and minimal, supporting maintainability and onboarding.

---

## Requirements
- Update documentation with every significant code or configuration change.
- Keep documentation minimal: only include what is needed to run, maintain, or extend the project.
- Use Markdown for all docs.
- Place all docs in the `docs/` folder.
- Reference Cursor rules, the single source of truth rule, and project standards in all new documentation. The README is the canonical source for onboarding and project standards.
- When updating documentation, always check for consistency with the single source of truth rule (see .cursor/rules/single-source-of-truth.mdc) and update the README if needed.

---

## Example
- Update `README.md` after adding a new server or API endpoint.
- Add a new rule file in `docs/reference/rules/` if a new standard is adopted.

---

## Maintenance
- Review documentation quarterly or after major releases.
